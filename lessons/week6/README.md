# Week 6 Meeting
This meeting occured during the date of November 10th, 2020.

# Summary
Given the scenario below, we programmed a robot using the FRC Command-Based Framework.

# Scenario
> For our newest outreach project, our team has decided to build a robot that can intake balls, move them, and place them. It will have a 6 wheel drivetrain and will be controlled by one driver with two controllers. The four motors will be dedicated to the drive train (0: front left, 1: front right, 2: back left, 3: back right), and two motors will be dedicated to the intake (4: top, 5: bottom). In order to intake the ball, the motors must spin in opposite directions, towards the center of the intake. Mechanical has graciously ensured that the ball is not able to enter the robot. In essence, once the ball has entered the intake, it will stay there until it is thrown out. Code this robot, ideally using the command-based framework.
